**You may be asked to enter Captcha while logging into LinkedIn after repeated use of the program. That's why there's a 15 second wait after entering your username and password, to solve the captcha.**

**LinkedIn may have a limit on the number of connection requests you can send in a week. I got a warning notification once, but haven't been blocked from sending connection requests yet. Please do inform if you encounter that limit.**
